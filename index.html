    <h1>Cricket: The Gentleman's Game</h1>

    <p>
        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field with a pitch in the center. At each end of the pitch are two sets of three wooden stumps, called wickets. The game involves one team batting, attempting to score runs by hitting the ball bowled by the opposing team's bowler and running between the wickets, while the fielding team tries to get batsmen out and prevent runs. Renowned for its strategy, history, and global following, especially in Commonwealth nations, cricket is often referred to as 'the gentleman's game' due to its emphasis on fair play and sportsmanship.
